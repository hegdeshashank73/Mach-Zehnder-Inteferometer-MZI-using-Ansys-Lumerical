# Mach-Zehnder-Inteferometer-MZI-using-Ansys-Lumerical
A Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is an optical device that utilizes the principles of interference to manipulate and measure light. It consists of a beam splitter that divides an incoming light beam into two separate paths, which then recombine at a second beam splitter. 
Designed and constructed a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) using Lumerical
software.
Implemented an enhanced path on one arm using silicon-on-silica technology.
The dimensions were set to ensure that the output was 180 degrees out of phase.
